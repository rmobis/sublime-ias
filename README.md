IAS Package for Sublime Text 3
==============================

Sublime IAS is a package to ease the development of code destined to be ran on the [IAS architecture][1] (most likely using a simulator). It includes snippets and syntax highlighting for both assembly and machine code.

This started mostly because I was taking a course on assembly language and this was the architecture of choice for the beginning of it.

Contributing
------------

If you have any code to add, please make a pull request. If you have any suggestion, please open an issue. Any contribution is welcome.



Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Raphael's Library will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
